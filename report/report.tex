\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this project, we implement a Sequential Refinement Planning Engine
(SeRPE)~\cite{disgusting-draft} for Pyhop~\cite{pyhop},
a simple planner written in Python.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

%% HTN
Hierarchical task network (HTN) is an automated planning method that uses networks
to give dependency among actions.
For a planning problem, we have a recipe to look for its solution
by decomposing the problem into subtasks.
A task network contains primitive tasks, which can be directly executed,
compound tasks, each of which is a sequence of actions,
and goal tasks, each of which satisfies a condition.

%% TODO what is Pyhop
Pyhop is a simple implementation of HTN written in Python. 
Pyhop represents states of the world using Python variable binding
 instead of logical propositions. Operators and methods in Pyhop are
 just Python functions with the current state as an argument.

%% TODO what is SePRE

\section{Approach}
We made an attempt to extend Pyhop to behave like SeRPE.

\section{Conclusion}

We have implemented a Pyhop extension for SePRE.
