\begin{abstract}
In this project, we implement a Sequential Refinement Planning Engine
(SeRPE)~\cite{serpe-draft} for Pyhop~\cite{pyhop},
a simple planner written in Python.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

%% HTN
\textbf{Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning} is an automated planning method that uses networks
to describe dependencies among actions.
For a particular planning problem, HTN planning takes each task and attempts to find a solution
by decomposing the problem into subtasks. The decomposition stops when all the tasks are broken down to \textit{primitive tasks} which can be directly performed by \textit{planning operators}.
A task network also contains 
\textit{compound tasks}, each of which is a sequence of actions,
\textit{and goal tasks}, each of which satisfies a condition.

%% TODO what is Pyhop
\textbf{Pyhop} is a simple implementation of HTN written in Python. 
Pyhop represents states of the world using Python variable binding
 instead of logical propositions. Operators and methods in Pyhop are
 just Python functions with the current state as an argument.

%% TODO what is SePRE
\textbf{Sequential Refinement Planning (SeRPE)} finds the best plan,
 which consists of an action sequence, for a refinement planning. 
Instead of an effect, a refinement planning will have a body which
 is a program. The program can have assignments, actions, tasks or
 even some control structures like if-then-else or while-loop.

SeRPE assumes all actions to be deterministic and all methods are 
sequential and cannot be executed in parallel.

\section{Approach}
We made an attempt to extend Pyhop to behave like SeRPE. 
First, we modified the use of HTN by replacing subtasks with 
body. Body can be any kind of program which consists of
 Python statements like if-else or while-loop.
Second, we use Python's `eval' function to implement the 
backtracking in execution stack for SeRPE. This will be a 
description action model for SeRPE rather than just execute
 the action in RAE. The execution stack will be similar to what
 already in Pyhop except that it will be used in the method's body.

\section{Implementation}

Our implementation is available online at
\begin{center}
\href{https://github.com/yakatz/CMSC722-KNW/tree/master/src}
{\tt https://github.com/yakatz/CMSC722-KNW/tree/master/src}
\end{center}

For an example, we modified the simple\_travel\_example given in Pyhop.
We made a situation where travel\_by\_taxi can cause failure because
the money is not enough. So, we add a refinement action 'go\_to\_bank'
which will help increase the money and execute the 'travel' task again.

\section{Conclusion}

We have attempted to implement an Pyhop extension for SePRE.
By using Python's 'eval' function, we can simulate the description 
action model for SeRPE.
