\begin{abstract}
In this project, we implement a Sequential Refinement Planning Engine
(SeRPE)~\cite{serpe-draft} for Pyhop~\cite{pyhop},
a simple planner written in Python.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

%% HTN
\textbf{Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning} is an automated planning method that uses networks
to describe dependencies among actions.
For a particular planning problem, HTN planning takes each task and attempts to find a solution
by decomposing the problem into subtasks. The decomposition stops when all the tasks are broken down to \textit{primitive tasks} which can be directly performed by \textit{planning operators}.
A task network also contains 
\textit{compound tasks}, each of which is a sequence of actions,
\textit{and goal tasks}, each of which satisfies a condition.

%% TODO what is Pyhop
\textbf{Pyhop} is a simple implementation of HTN written in Python. 
Pyhop represents states of the world using Python variable binding
 instead of logical propositions. Operators and methods in Pyhop are
 just Python functions with the current state as an argument.

%% TODO what is SePRE
\textbf{Sequential Refinement Planning (SeRPE)} is an improvement to Refinement Planning. Refinement Planning algorithms may need to make choices to determine what their next course of action will be. At each choice, SeRPE looks at all the available choices and using descriptive models, attempts to predict the outcome of each possible action.
Instead of considering each action having a particular effect (like HTN), a refinement planning will have a body which
 is a program. The program can have assignments, actions, tasks or
 even some control structures like if-then-else or while-loop.

SeRPE assumes all actions to be deterministic and all methods are 
sequential and cannot be executed in parallel.

\section{Related work}
There is a long history of planning software for a variety of different algorithms. One of the first HTN planners was published in 1975.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pyhop. HTN Planner on which our SeRPE implementation is based. \cite{pyhop}
  
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach}
We made an attempt to extend Pyhop to behave like SeRPE. 
First, we modified the use of HTN by replacing subtasks with 
body. Body can be any kind of program which consists of
 Python statements like if-else or while-loop.
Second, we use Python's \texttt{eval} function to implement the 
backtracking in execution stack for SeRPE. This will be a 
description action model for SeRPE rather than just execute
 the action in RAE. The execution stack will be similar to what
 already in Pyhop except that it will be used in the method's body.

\section{Implementation}

Our implementation is available online at
\begin{center}
\href{https://github.com/yakatz/CMSC722-KNW/tree/master/src}
{\tt https://github.com/yakatz/CMSC722-KNW/tree/master/src}
\end{center}

For an example, we modified the \texttt{simple\_travel\_example} given in Pyhop.
We made a situation where \texttt{travel\_by\_taxi} can cause failure because
the money is not enough. So, we add a refinement action \texttt{go\_to\_bank}
which will help increase the money and execute the \texttt{travel} task again.

Below is the code for \texttt{execute\_action}:

{\small
\begin{alltt}
def execute_action(action, state, old_state, *action_args):
    if state == False:
        return False
    if action in operators:  # predict action
        operator = operators[action]       
        if len(action_args) > 1: # deal with the training comma in the tuple
            result = eval('operator(copy.deepcopy(state),action_args)')
        else:
            result = eval('operator(copy.deepcopy(state),action_args[0])')
        if result != False:
            return result
        else:
            return False  # backtrack
    elif action in methods: # new task
        relevant = methods[action]
        for method in relevant:
        return False
    return False
\end{alltt}}

And here is how \texttt{travel\_by\_taxi} uses it:
{\small
\begin{alltt}
def travel_by_taxi(state, a, x, y):
    import copy
    if state.cash[a] >= taxi_rate(state.dist[x][y]):
        result = copy.deepcopy(state)
        result = pyhop_SeRPE.execute_action('call_taxi', result, state, (a, x))
        result = pyhop_SeRPE.execute_action('ride_taxi', result, state, (a, x, y))
        result = pyhop_SeRPE.execute_action('pay_driver', result, state, (a))
        subtasks = [('call_taxi', a, x),
                    ('ride_taxi', a, x, y),
                    ('pay_driver', a)]
                   if result != False else False
        return \{'state':result, 'subtasks':subtasks\}
    else:
        result = copy.deepcopy(state)
        result = pyhop_SeRPE.execute_action('go_to_bank', result, state, (a))
        result = pyhop_SeRPE.execute_action('travel', result, state, (a, x, y))
        subtasks = [('go_to_bank', a),
                    ('travel', a, x, y)]
                   if result != False else False
        return \{'state':result, 'subtasks':subtasks\}
\end{alltt}}

\section{Conclusion}

We have attempted to implement an Pyhop extension for SePRE.
By using Python's \texttt{eval} function, we can simulate the description 
action model for SeRPE.
